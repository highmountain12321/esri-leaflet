# L.esri.ClusteredFeatureLayer

This plugin relies on [Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster), which is not yet compatible with [Leaflet 1.0 beta 1](http://leafletjs.com/2015/07/15/leaflet-1.0-beta1-released.html).

Please check out our own Clustered Feature Layer [repository](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-clustered-feature-layer) in Github for documentation and examples for using the plugin in applications built on top of Leaflet 0.7.3.
